Our CPS Test made its debut on September 5, 2019. On that first day, a single user from Canada, who happened to be a friend, took the test. The next day, 27 more users, also our friends, joined in the testing. Within just two months, the average daily user count for our CPS Test had swelled to between 200 and 300, with many professional gamers among them. Now over 30,000 users take our CPS Test each day. Thank you for your trust in us. We are very proud of this achievement.

Ever since its inception, we have persistently developed and improved the CPS Test by adding new features, games, and detailed reports. Even though several websites have brazenly copied our design and features, the Wayback Machine remains a decent tool for verifying the authenticity of our original work.

We are a team of experienced developers with years of expertise in game development and esports. We constantly strive to make the CPS Test an outstanding online resource for assessing your gaming abilities and physical skills. Feel free to bookmark our CPS Test and explore new features and games as they are introduced.
